# Stock-Trend-Prediction
This repository contains the code to implement a stacked recurrent neural network using LSTM and regularization layers.
Keras package for deep learning was used to implement the model.
The data used is of Google's stock price for over 5 years.
Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 kernel was used to execute the project.
RNN model was trained to learn the price of stock at a given day from learning the stock trend of previous 60 days.
